# AGENTS.md

## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

This is a blank/skeleton repository named "Experiment" containing only a `README.md`. There is no application code, no dependencies, no build system, and no services to run.

- **No package manager lockfiles or dependency files exist** — no `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, etc.
- **No services to start** — no backend, frontend, database, or other infrastructure.
- **No tests, lint, or build commands** — none are configured.
- Other branches (`android-security-analysis`, `apk-paid-feature-removal`, `pentestgpt-*`) contain static markdown reports and APK analysis artifacts, not runnable application code.

When application code is added to this repository, this file should be updated with relevant development setup instructions, lint/test/build commands, and any non-obvious caveats.
